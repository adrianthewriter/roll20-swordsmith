# Runesmith

_Runesmith_ is a tool for generating custom [Roll20](https://roll20.net) character sheets from [React](https://reactjs.org) components.

It is a work in progress. Use at your own risk ðŸ˜Ž

## Usage

Add _Runesmith_ to your project along with React and React-Dom.

```
yarn add https://github.com/adrianthewriter/runesmith
yarn add react react-dom
```

Add the following scripts to your `package.json` file.

```
"scripts": {
  "start": "runesmith start",
  "build": "runesmith build"
},
```

### About aliases

To resolve aliases in your templates, include a `jsconfig.json` file and configure the _baseUrl_ and _paths_ properties. Runesmith is configured to look here when configuring your aliases inside webpack.

## Todo

- [x] Render _layout_ components from the `src/layout` directory to a mock roll20.net app in when using `yarn start`
- [x] Generate _project-name.html_ and _project-name.css_ in `build` directory that are ready to upload to roll20.net as a custom character sheet when using `yarn build`
- [x] Append _roll template_ components from `src/templates` directory to _project-name.html_ when using `yarn build`
- [x] Process and bundle SheetWorker javascript in the `src/scripts` directory and append it to _project-name.html_ when using `yarn build`
- [ ] Generate a _translation.json_ file if i18n tags are used on the sheet when using `yarn build`
- [ ] Generate a customizable project _README_ when using `yarn build`
